# Chat Palooza

This is a research project into the capabilities of real-time AI conversations.

Currently it only supports conversations between Gemini Live models, but it is designed to be extensible to other models.

## Server

The server is a Node.js application that provides a WebSocket API for real-time AI conversations.

## Client
